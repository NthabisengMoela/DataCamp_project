# DataCamp #

[**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com) is an online learning platfrom with interactive courses, practices, and projects. Not only R but Python is appied in different projects, and those mini-projects could help you hone your coding skill and the machine learning knowledge!

In general, those projects need basic data wrangling and data visualization skill in tidyverse way (recommended), and the corresponding cheat sheets also be provided in [here](https://github.com/jusliu9547/DataCamp/tree/master/Cheatsheet). I consider that it's fairly hard to remember all the functions in different packages, so the cheat sheets come in handy for us to check out the frequently used functions and arguments!

Here, I will update the project from **DataCamp** everyday until finishing all projects!
