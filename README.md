# DataCamp 

[**DataCamp**](https://www.datacamp.com) is an online learning platfrom with interactive courses, practices, and projects. Not only R but Python is appied in different projects, and those mini-projects could help you hone your coding skill and the machine learning knowledge! You can also find some useful cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/jusliu9547/DataCamp/tree/master/Cheatsheet) in case of forgetting some functions or arguments

Here, I will update the project from **DataCamp** everyday until finishing all projects! Leave a :star: if helpful! :wink:
